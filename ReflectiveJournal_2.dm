Finding information in World Wide Web is something that we sometimes take for granted.  Search engine GOOGLE use keywords to find the best matches with higher rank. Meaning that the link relating to your search should be the first one. However, so much information stored can be used against you or disturb your Privacy. Google is so dominating the digital market that some people think that it represents Internet. The algorithm is changing constantly that make it hard to understand. Its sounds like artificial intelligence learning by itself. Moreover, the company can manipulate the algorithm and change your page ranking and of course change the rules (market). No one have control on GOOGLE they are too powerful. It’s possible that they are directing your search to promote their products. Google could exploit the shopping market and consumer’s wont even notice or understand it. There is no other search engine that can replace Google, using this power unfairly.  Users trust this company because there are no other competitors to them.  There are a lot of conspiracy about this subject but it’s your decision what to believe; however the truth sometimes is well hidden. We all are doing similar searches finding the same information. Our understanding of the world is shaped from one company. We do this on daily basis and its kind of sad.

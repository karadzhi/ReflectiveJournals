GitHub helped me track my group development. It is a good way of storing my software projects and works collaboratively with my team. It works like a web storage excellent way to back up your information, to be prepared for surprises caused by your computer. I’m still confused working with GitHub, but I think Ill get better and better with time. Moreover, I have options of manipulating my project by Git command line.  Furthermore, useful part is that it works like a social media app, Instagram for example. You can follow your teacher, friends, colleges, and course mates and start learning from them. GitHub also operates other service called Gist with a use of hosting codes or larger projects. Agile project management helped me adapt my group. It is good help to us by working more effectively and clears errors.  In my opinion we are really great group because we have communication and feedback to each other that help us to learn from our mistakes and get rid of unnecessary bugs. We put to test each ones work and after that we finally put them together for testing before release. There are a lot of positive outcomes from GitHub, which I’m glad learning.

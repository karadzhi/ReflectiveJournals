My group theme is about Cyberpunk, Strong Encryption and Society. There are different theories about Cyberpunk. One that makes me interested about says that man will no longer be top of food chain. Makes you think what is our destiny and what future awaits us there. Together side by side with technology or like the movie 'I ROBOT' total extinction of human race. However, these are just theories you choose what to believe in. We live in technological society that we develop on daily basis. That means cyberpunk is closer that we think. However, how can we protect our devices when computer hacking is on its peak?!  Strong cryptography makes the job of intelligence surveillance agencies difficult. Furthermore, because of that after World War 2, United States has forbidden export of cryptography beyond of certain strength. This is good way of catching bad guys but on the other hand when people think about it we donâ€™t have freedom, someone can always check your conversation, web history and etc.  Our society is build upon technology we either accept it or live in outcast from the society. In my opinion we as human beings need to fight for our privacy and technology rights and of course learn how to love and live side by side with high tech.
